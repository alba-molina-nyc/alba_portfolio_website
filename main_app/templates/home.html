<blockquote class="flow-text">
   Hi there! Thanks for checking out my website! My name is Alba Molina and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. In one of my previous lives I was a Business Development Representative and moved my way up to leadership in the SaaS/tech industry. That's when I fell in love with the industry!

  <blockquote class="flow-text">
    But let's take it back a bit... to when I was no more than six years old... You see, I always knew I wanted to be an entreprenuer... it's in my blood! I vividly remember going to "el mercado" with Mama Flora, my grandmother, as she went on to handle her loyal customers at her humble cheese selling business in San Salvador! <br>

  <blockquote class="flow-text">
    Fast forward to my 24th birthday and I became an SDR! Boom I was selling software to enterprise businesses! Getting my feet wet in this industry made me realize that I not only wanted to be an entreprenuer... but a <b>tech entreprenuer</b>!<br>

        My work ethic, communication skills, as well as my growth mindset. That said, if you are looking for a backend developer that has all of the above and then some, let's chat!</blockquote>
