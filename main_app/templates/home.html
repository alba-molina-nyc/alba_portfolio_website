     Hi thanks for checking out my website! My name is Alba Molina and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. In one of my previous lives I was a Business Development Representative at a Software Compay and moved my way up to leadership. That's when I fell in love with the software/tech industry!

      <b>Turns out making technology sexy through words as a BDR made me realize that I also wanted to build sexy software! I am obsessed with making people's tedious day to day worklife easier so that they can spend time focusing on what really matters to them. <br><br>
    My path from Business/Sales Development Leadership and into the developer world is intentionally geared torwards my ultimate goal of founding something of my own.
    <br>
    <br>
    I think what really distinguished me from the pack throughout my entire sales career was my work ethic, communication skills, as well as my growth mindset. That said, those three items set me apart as I look for a backend developer role at a fast growth software company. 
Hire Alba Molina!</b>
