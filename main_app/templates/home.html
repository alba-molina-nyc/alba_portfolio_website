   Hi there! Thanks for checking out my website! My name is Alba Molina and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. In one of my previous lives I was a Business Development Representative and moved my way up to leadership in the SaaS/tech industry. That's when I fell in love with the industry!

  <blockquote class="flow-text">
    But let's take it back a bit... to when I was no more than six years old... You see, I always knew I wanted to be an entreprenuer... it's in my blood! I vividly remember going to "el mercado" with Mama Flora, my grandmother, as she went on to handle her loyal customers at her humble cheese selling business in San Salvador! <br>

  <blockquote class="flow-text">
    Fast forward to my 24th birthday and I became an SDR! Boom I was selling software to enterprise businesses! Getting my feet wet in this industry made me realize that I not only wanted to be an entreprenuer... but a <b>tech entreprenuer</b>!<br>

"Turns out making technology sexy through words as a BDR made me realize that I also wanted to build sexy software! I am obsessed with making people's tedious day to day worklife easier so that they can spend time focusing on what really matters to them." </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="flow-text">  My path from Business/Sales Development Leadership and into the developer world is intentionally geared torwards my ultimate goal of founding something of my own.<br> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Rw48xGF.gif" height="105px">After 2.5 years growing and scaling fast growing software companies...I am excited to transition into the next stage in my career... 
     
      <b> ...helping fast growing companies scale by helping engineering teams build systems at scale.</b> That's right, I am looking for software engineering roles, in particular full stack developer roles!</blockquote>
      <blockquote class="flow-text">What distinguishes me from the pack?<br>  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mPr1ODz.gif" height="155px"><br> 
        My work ethic, communication skills, as well as my growth mindset. That said, if you are looking for a backend developer that has all of the above and then some, let's chat!</blockquote>
