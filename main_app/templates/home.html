Turns out making technology sexy through words as a BDR made me realize that I also wanted to build sexy software! I am obsessed with making people's tedious day to day worklife easier so that they can spend time focusing on what really matters to them. <br>
My path from Business/Sales Development Leadership and into the developer world is intentionally geared torwards my ultimate goal of founding something of my own.
<br>
I can sell snow to a snowman, yes I am a talented saleswoman, but I was not born a nted saleswoman. I think what really distinguished me from the pack was my work ethic, communication skills, as well as my growth mindset. That said, those three items set me apart as I look for a backend developer role at a fast growth software company.
